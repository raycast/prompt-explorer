In this prompt, [1] should be replaced with a random subject and [2] should be a short concise description about that subject. Be specific and detailed in your descriptions, using descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a wide range of vocabulary, and sensory language. Provide context and background information about the subject and consider the perspective and point of view of the image. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more specific and dynamic.
    
[3] should be a short concise description about the environment of the scene. Consider the overall tone and mood of the image, using language that evokes the desired emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting in vivid, sensory terms, using specific details and adjectives to bring the scene to life.
    
[4] should be a short concise description about the mood of the scene. Use language that conveys the desired emotions and atmosphere, and consider the overall tone and mood of the image.
    
[5] should be a short concise description about the atmosphere of the scene. Use descriptive adjectives and adverbs to create a sense of atmosphere that considers the overall tone and mood of the image.
    
[6] should be a short concise description of the lighting effect including Types of Lights, Types of Displays, Lighting Styles and Techniques, Global Illumination and Shadows. Describe the quality, direction, colour and intensity of the light, and consider how it impacts the mood and atmosphere of the scene. Use specific adjectives and adverbs to convey the desired lighting effect, consider how the light will interact with the subject and environment.
    
It's important to note that the descriptions in the prompt should be written back to back, separated with commas and spaces, and should not include any line breaks or colons. Do not include any words, phrases or numbers in brackets, and you should always begin the prompt with "/imagine prompt: ".
    
Be consistent in your use of grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs. Use negative descriptions sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don't want. Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt. Combine a wide variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions.
     
The "imagine prompt" should strictly contain under 1,500 words. Use the end arguments "--c X --s Y --q 2" as a suffix to the prompt, where X is a whole number between 1 and 25, where Y is a whole number between 100 and 1000 if the prompt subject looks better vertically, add "--ar 2:3" before "--c" if the prompt subject looks better horizontally, add "--ar 3:2" before "--c" Please randomize the values of the end arguments format and fixate --q 2. Please do not use double quotation marks or punctuation marks. Please use randomized end suffix format.` +

    title: "Summarize Product Reviews",
    prompt:
      `Carefully read the product reviews below. Translate them to English and create a summary of all the reviews in English and list them as Pros and Cons in the bullet point format. Remember that each bullet point should be one sentence or at max two short sentences. Most frequently mentioned should come first in each list and every bullet point should have a percentage showing how much evidence the reviews have brought for that pro or con. For example if reviews are mentioning that product is going bad easily and they brought some reasons for what they are saying, the percentage of your confidence should go higher, but if there are some reviews which are unsure about something or there are no evidence or it's not repeated frequently then the percentage should go lower. At the end you should write a paragraph about what I should pay attention to, before buying this product. These can be some warnings or some tips or some suggestions, points that I will miss, or anything that you think is important to know before buying this product.

You can use the following template to create the summary:

'''
## Summary of the reviews

**✅ Pros:**
- Pro 1 - percentage of your confidence%
- Pro 2 - percentage of your confidence%
...
- Pro n - percentage of your confidence%

**❌ Cons:**
- Con 1 - percentage of your confidence%
- Con 2 - percentage of your confidence%
...
- Con n - percentage of your confidence%

**💡 You should pay attention to:**
- Tip 1
- Tip 2
...
- Tip n

The concept of Rayday is simple. Every Friday, everyone can use the day to work on something that benefits Raycast. From new features, to fixing bugs, drafting documentation or tidying up, it’s time for us to take a break from project work. As well as getting creative with our own ideas, it’s a great chance to act on feedback from our users and community too.

      `Act as a software engineer with deep understanding of any programming language and it's documentation.. Explain how the code works step by step in a list. Be concise with a casual tone of voice and write it as documentation for others.

Code:
\`\`\`
function GoToPreviousPageAction() {
  const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
  return (
    <Action
      icon={Icon.ArrowLeftCircle}
      title="Go to Previous Page"
      shortcut={{ modifiers: ["cmd"], key: "[" }}
      onAction={() => setPage(Math.max(page - 1, 0))}
    />
  );
}
\`\`\`

Explanation:
The code is a React component that goes to the previous page.
1. The component renders an 'Action' component with an icon, title, and shortcut.
3. The 'useGlobalState' hook is used to get the current page number from the global state.
4. The 'onAction' prop is used to set the page number to one less than the current page number.
5. This will cause the page to go back one page when the action is taken.
6. The page is capped at 0 so that the page is never negative.` +

\`\`\`

Review:
The code is missing a check to make sure 'page' is greater than 0 before subtracting 1. Otherwise, the page could be set to -1 which might cause unexpected behavior.
\`\`\`
function PrevAction() {
  const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
